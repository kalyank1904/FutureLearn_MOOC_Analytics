Nice, this is the last “easy marks” piece 
Below is a **FULL, COMPLETE, MARK-SAFE `README.md`** written exactly to satisfy **your rubric** and what markers expect for a **ProjectTemplate + renv + RMarkdown** submission.

# FutureLearn MOOC Learning Analytics Project

## Project Overview

This project presents a reproducible learning analytics investigation using
interaction data from multiple runs of a FutureLearn Massive Open Online Course
(MOOC). The aim of the analysis is to explore learner engagement with individual
course steps and to identify patterns that may inform course design and
improve learner retention.

The analysis follows the **CRISP-DM** framework and consists of **two
consecutive investigation cycles**, progressing from exploratory data
analysis to more advanced modelling techniques.

The project is implemented using **ProjectTemplate** to enforce a structured
and reproducible workflow, **renv** to manage package dependencies, and
**R Markdown** to generate the final analysis report.

## Stakeholder and Business Context

The primary stakeholder for this investigation is the **FutureLearn course
provider**. Understanding how learners interact with different parts of the
course is important for:

* Identifying high-impact and low-engagement course steps
* Improving course structure and content sequencing
* Supporting evidence-based redesign of learning materials

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard **ProjectTemplate** directory structure:

### Directory Description

* **data/**
  Contains raw FutureLearn datasets. These files are never modified manually.

* **munge/**
  Contains all data preprocessing and feature engineering scripts. These scripts
  clean, transform, and cache datasets for analysis.

* **cache/**
  Stores cached R objects generated by the munge scripts. This enables fast and
  reproducible analysis.

* **config/**
  Contains ProjectTemplate configuration settings.

* **reports/**
  Contains the R Markdown file used to generate the final analysis report.

## Setup Instructions

### Software Requirements

* R (version compatible with renv lockfile)
* RStudio
* Git

### Project Setup

1. Open the project by double-clicking
   `FutureLearn_MOOC_Analytics.Rproj`

2. Restore the project package environment using renv:

   ```r
   renv::restore()
   ```

3. Load the ProjectTemplate project:

   ```r
   library(ProjectTemplate)
   load.project()
   ```

This will automatically:

* Load required packages
* Run all preprocessing scripts in `munge/`
* Load cached datasets into the environment

---

## Running the Analysis

To generate the analysis report:

1. Open the file:

   ```
   reports/main_report.Rmd
   ```

2. Click **Knit** in RStudio

This will produce an HTML report containing:

* Two full CRISP-DM investigation cycles
* Exploratory data analysis and visualisations
* Clustering and predictive modelling results
* Evaluation and discussion of findings

---

## Reproducibility

This project is fully reproducible:

* All package versions are fixed using **renv**
* Data preprocessing is automated using **ProjectTemplate**
* No manual data loading or manipulation is required
* The report can be regenerated from a clean R session by knitting the R
  Markdown file

---

## Version Control

Version control is managed using **Git**.

* The file `GitLog.txt` contains the full commit history of the project.
* Commits were made regularly throughout development with informative messages
  documenting project progress.
